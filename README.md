# Demo of Spring Boot application with GKE and Docker

This Spring Boot application was deployed on `Google Kubernetes Engine` during my free trial on `Google Cloud`. To automate the deployment to GKE, I used `GitLab CI/CD` pipeline which can be retrieve in `.gitlab-ci file`.

All the `deployment kubernetes` file are in the `k8s package`.
